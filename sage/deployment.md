# Deployment

::: warning PHP versions must match
Make sure the PHP version of your development environment matches the PHP version of your production environment, or you may hit a fatal error due to your Composer dependencies requiring a different PHP version.
:::

## Deploying a Sage-based WordPress theme

1. Build theme assets (`yarn build`)
2. Install Composer dependencies (`composer install --no-dev  --optimize-autoloader`)
3. Upload all files and folders in your theme except the `node_modules` directory to your host

## Optimization

Similar to deploying a Laravel app, Acorn supports an `optimize` command that will cache your configuration and views. This command should be run as part of your deployment process:

```shell
wp acorn optimize
```

## Server configuration

::: tip Using Trellis or Radicle?
If you are using [Trellis](/trellis/) to provision your production environment, or you are using [Radicle](/radicle/), you can **skip** this section.
:::

### Securing Blade templates

Due to the nature of WordPress, any file residing in the theme folder is publicly accessible. By default, webservers will return any requests made to a `*.blade.php` template as plain-text.

**This can create an opening for potential security risks as well as unwanted snooping.**

To prevent this from happening, we will need to add configuration to the web server to deny access to the file extension.

#### Nginx

If you are using Nginx, add the following to your site configuration before the final location directive:

```nginx
location ~* \.(blade\.php)$ {
    deny all;
}
```

#### Apache

If you are using Apache, add the following to your virtual host configuration or the `.htaccess` file at the root of your web application:

```apache
<FilesMatch ".+\.(blade\.php)$">
    # Apache 2.4
    <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
        Require all denied
    </IfModule>

    # Apache 2.2
    <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
        Order deny,allow
        Deny from all
    </IfModule>
</FilesMatch>
```

## Deploying Sage with Trellis

If you use [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/), you can build your assets locally (or on a CI server), then copy them to the remote server during deployment. 
[See the `build-before.yml` example hook](https://github.com/roots/trellis/blob/master/deploy-hooks/build-before.yml) in Trellis.

## Deploying Sage on Kinsta

[Kinsta supports Bedrock and Trellis](https://kinsta.com/blog/bedrock-trellis/?kaid=OFDHAJIXUDIV), so deploying Sage with Trellis on [Kinsta](https://kinsta.com/?kaid=OFDHAJIXUDIV) is possible by following a few extra steps.

## Deploying Sage on WP Engine

See the instructions from [`wpengine/example-sage-theme`](https://github.com/wpengine/example-sage-theme).
